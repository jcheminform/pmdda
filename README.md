This repo is for 'Reproducible untargeted metabolomics data analysis workflow for exhaustive MS/MS annotation'. To access standalone PMDDA workflow, please install `rmwf` package from [GitHub](https://github.com/yufree/rmwf) and use `rmarkdown::draft("test.Rmd", template = "PMDDA", package = "rmwf")` to create a reproducible workflow document for your own studies. Such workflow is also available through [xcmsrocker](https://hub.docker.com/r/yufree/xcmsrocker/) project.

# Description

- script.Rmd: the reproducible documents for the paper with all of the details. Some of the files in this repo is generated by this document.

- script.html: generated html document from script.Rmd.

- renv folder: using `renv` package to create the reproducible data analysis environment for this repo.

- doc folder: host script.html as a webpage.

- data folder: MS1 full scan data for five NIST 1950 and five matrix sample in positive mode.

- datan folder: MS1 full scan data for five NIST 1950 and five matrix sample in negative mode.
